# MuffinButton
WPF Muffin Button Control.

# Usage
In your project (.NET 3.5+), add a reference to the DLL of this project. Add this control in like you would any other for the backend.

If using XAML, add a reference to the namespace, like:

`xmlns:mb="clr-namespace:MButton;assembly=MButton"`

From there, you can create new buttons with:

`<mb:MuffinButton />`

It inherits from a button, so you can treat it just like any other button.
